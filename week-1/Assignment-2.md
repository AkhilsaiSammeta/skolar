# Assignment 2: IDE Selection

Choose a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from the following options: **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** or **Jupyter Notebook**. Install the selected IDE on your computer.

## Steps to Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. **Download VS Code:**
   - Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Click on the download link suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install VS Code:**
   - Run the downloaded installer.
   - Follow the installation instructions.
   - Once installed, open VS Code.

3. **Install Python Extension:**
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "Python" and install the extension provided by Microsoft.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a new terminal in VS Code (`Terminal` > `New Terminal`).
   - Type `python --version` to check if Python is recognized by VS Code.

## Steps to Install Jupyter Notebook

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook using pip:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the command: `pip install notebook`

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   - After installation, in the terminal or command prompt, run the command: `jupyter notebook`
   - This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Create a new notebook and run a simple Python code to ensure Jupyter Notebook is working properly.

**Note:** Both IDEs are powerful tools for Python development. Choose the one that best fits your needs and preferences.
